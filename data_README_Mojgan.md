## /* *__Modern and fossil abundance data of radiolarian species Amphimelissa setosa in the Northern Hemisphere__*
### **Description**:
 >*"Using our new and published data on the distribution of A. setosa in plankton, sediment trap, surface sediment  
 > and downcore samples, we provide a quantitative ecological context for the occurrence of this species."

 ## /* *__Age-depth relation of sediment core Hoton-2 from Hoton-Nur Lake (Khoton Nuur), Mongolian Altai, Mongolia.__*
 ### **Description**:
 >*"The recovered core consists of compact inorganic gray-blue clay (below 205 cm) and striate gray clay and silt  
 > (above 205 cm) with a touch of organic matter. Vegetational cover of the eastern and northern parts of the  
 > Hoton-Nur basin is presented by cold-tolerant steppe vegetation and often intercalated with kobresian and sedge communities."

 ## /* *__Planktic foraminiferal stable oxygen isotopes of Globigerinoides ruber and Mg/Ca sea surface temperature reconstructions of sediment core RAPID-21-12B from Gardar Drift over the last 230 years__*
 ### **Description**:
 > *" We present a 230 year long record of SPNA surface conditions reconstructed from a very high accumulation rate core that  
 > also registers changes in deep flow speed in the Iceland Basin. A lagged correlation is observed between the records of deep  
 > flow speed and stable oxygen isotopic composition of the surface SPNA (δ18Ow), with strongest correlation when the paleoflow  
 > speed record leads by 15–20 years. These records reveal a decadal‐scale coupling between surface and deep ocean variability  
 > over the past 230 years, possibly driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation, with implications for North Atlantic circulation and climate.
